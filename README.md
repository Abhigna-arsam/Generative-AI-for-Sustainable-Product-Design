# Sustainable Product Design with Generative AI

## Overview

This project addresses the growing environmental impact in product design, specifically focusing on reducing e-waste, pollution, and resource depletion. By leveraging Generative AI, the project aims to create sustainable product designs that consider critical parameters such as manufacturing processes, product life cycle, waste minimization, and environmental impact simulation.

Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize sustainable product design, yet its full potential remains largely untapped. This research develops a tool that enables companies to create novel, environmentally friendly product designs that integrate sustainability goals, including zero-waste production, biodegradable materials, and optimized manufacturing processes.

The project also tackles the challenges related to ensuring data quality, accuracy of designs, and the complexity of AI model development and deployment.
